```

### Seasonality in Data

reasons, weather, tourism... multiplication factor for the different
seasons

pop mean / season mean \> multiplication factor

multiplication factor \* data of that concrete position

### Bivariate analysis

1.  Relationship

-   Scatterplots (linear relationship? if not transform variables.)

2.  Correlations

-   Linear correlation quantifies the strength of the linear
    relationship.
-   If no correlation no tendency to get the effect modified one by the
    other.
-   Correlation is used to drop non-usable variable

3.  Create new variables

-   Using business knowledge and bivariate analysis to modify variable

-   Use mean/Median of variables conveying similar type information

-   Create ratio variable which are more relevant to business

-   Transform variable by taking log, exponential, roots etc. 3.1
    Transformation

    -   for log data -- log(x+1)
    -   for exp data -- e\^x
    -   for xxxxxxxx -- x\^2 or x\^n

```{r Variable_transformation1}

pairs(~price+crime_rate, data = df)
plot(df$price,df$crime_rate)
df$crime_rate<-log(1+df$crime_rate)

library(dummies)

df <- dummy.data.frame(df)
df<-df[,-9]

```

### Correlation matrix

Correlation: - statistical measure that indicates the extent to which
two or ore variables fluctuate together.

Correlation coefficient: \
- Value to the relationship \
- Correlation coefficients have a value between -1 and 1 \
- A 0 means there is no relationship between the variables at all \
- -1 and 1 mean perfect correlation (negative or positive)

Correlation vs causation - Correlation doesn't imply causation

Correlation matrix \
- Table showing the correlation coefficients between variables \
- Each cell in the table shows th correlation between two variables \
- Correlation matrix is use s a way to summarize data, as an input into
a more advanced analysis, and as a diagnostic for advanced analyses.

Applications: \
- Summarize large amounts of data where the goal is to see patterns. \
- Identify collinearity in the data.

```{r Correlation_matrix}

cor(df)
round(cor(df),2)
df <- df[,-16]

```

## Module 6 Lineal regression models

Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship
between a dependent variables and independent variables.

Questions: - Prediction question how accurate can predict given all
variables and values - Inferential question How accurate can we estimate
the effect of each of the variables

1.  Basic equations and ordinary least squared method Y = B0 + B1*X
    price= B0 + B1*num_rooms

-   Estimating coefficients

    -   Goal : Obtain B0 and B1
    -   ei = yi - Å·i

-   Residual: difference between the observed value and the estimted by
    the linear model.

-   Residual sum of squares (RSS) the least squares approah chosses B0
    and B1 to minimize the RSS. Using some calculus, one can show that
    the minimizers are

B1=sum(xi-x)(yi-y)/sum(xi-x)\^2 B0 = y - B1x

2.  Assessing Accuracy of predicted Coefficients

Y= B0+B1\*X+E

-   Standard error in coefficients

    o\^2 is not known, but can be estimate from the data. This estimate
    is known as the residual standard error (RSE)

    RSE = sqroot(RSS/(n-2))

    There is approximately a 95% chance that the interval [B1-2*SE(B1),
    B1+2*SE(B1)]

    will contain the true value of B1

-   Hypothesis test

    is there any relationship between X and Y Y = B0 + B1\*x if b1 is 0
    there is no relationship Ho= There's no relationship between x and y
    Ha = there's some relationship between X and y Ho: B1=0 Ha: B1!=0

    To disapprove Ho, we calculate T statistics We also compute the
    probability of observing ny value equal to /t/ or Larger Te call
    this the probability p-value a small p-value means there is an
    association between the predictor and the response (typically less
    than 5% on 1%)

3.  Assessing model accuracy - RSE and R Squared

Quality of Fit RSE RSE is the average amount that the response will
deviate from the true regression line. It's also considered as a measure
of lack of fit of the model to the data.

Quality of fit R\^2 Is the proportion of variance explained. Always
takes on a value between 0 and 1 Is independent of the scale of Y.

R\^2 = 1 - (Residual sum of squares / total sum of squares)

```{r Simple_linear_regression}
 simple_model <- lm(price~room_num, data = df)

summary(simple_model)

plot(df$room_num,df$price)
abline(simple_model)

```

4.  Multiple linear regression

Y= B0 + B1*X1 + B2*X2 ... + e

-   F statistics

Probability of wrongly classify B as significant if number of variables
is large, there is very high chance that one of the B is wrongly
classified.

F = ((TSS -RSS)/p)/(RSS/(n-p-1))

-   Interpreting the results for categorical variable intercepts and
    p-values

```{r multiple_linear_regression}

multiple_model <- lm(price~., data=df)
summary(multiple_model)

```

5.  Test train split

Mean square error of new test data results

Validation set approach 80:20 split (larg N)

Leave one out cross validation leave one out on every training set

K-Fold validation Divide the data in k sets we keep one testing and k1
fo training

6.  Bias Variance Trade-off Expected test error = E(bias) +
    E(variance) + E(e)

Bias Variance Trade-off Find the minimum of the sum of both

```{r Test-Train_Split_in_R}
install.packages("caTools")
library(caTools)
set.seed(0)

split = sample.split(df, SplitRatio = 0.8)
training_set <- subset(df,split ==TRUE)
test_set<- subset(df, split== FALSE)

lm_a <- lm(price~.,data = training_set)

train_a<- predict(lm_a, training_set)
test_a<- predict(lm_a, test_set)

mean((training_set$price-train_a)^2)
mean((test_set$price-test_a)^2)

```

## Module 7 Modelos de regression distintos de OLS

Other linear models Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2... E RSS = e\^2 +e\^2 ....
Alternatives for prediction accuracy and model interpretability

-   Subset selection Instead of training the model on all variables, we
    will be using a subset of available variables
-   Shrinkage method : We will try to regularize (i.e. shrink the
    coefficient of some variables towards zero)

1.  Subset selection techniques

Select the subset of variables the work \
1. Best subset selection \
- let M0 denote the null model with no predictors \
- Mk being the models using k predictors an select the smallest RSS (
probar totes les combinations possibles de 1 var, 2 var.... etc )\
- Select a single model using adjusted R\^2 for each group pf models \
- Select the better model among the selected using RÂ²

2.  Forward Step-wise selection

-   M0 null model with no predictors
-   Consider all pk models that augment the predictors Mk with one
    additional predictor
-   Choose the best among these p-k models and call it Mk+1. Here best
    is defined as having smallest RSS or highest RÂ²
-   Select a single best model from among MO to Mp using adjusted RÂ²

3.  Backward Step-wise selection (Only if N\>num of variables)

-   Let Mp denote the full model, witch contains all p predictors
-   Consider all k models that contain all but one of the predictors in
    Mk, for a total of k -1 predictors. -Choose the best among these k
    models and call it Mk-1. Here bet is defined as having smallest RSS
    or highest RÂ²
-   Select a single best model from among M0 to Mp using adjusted RÂ²

```{r Subset_selection}

install.packages("leaps")
library("leaps")

# Subset selection techniques
lm_best<-regsubsets(price~., data= df, nvmax = 15)
summary(lm_best)
summary(lm_best)$adjr2
which.max(summary(lm_best)$adjr2)
coef(lm_best,8)


# Forward step-wise selection
lm_fwd <- regsubsets(price~.,data = df, nvmax = 15, method = "forward")
summary(lm_fwd)
summary(lm_fwd)$adjr2
which.max(summary(lm_fwd)$adjr2)
coef(lm_fwd,8)


# Backward step-wise selection
lm_bkw <- regsubsets(price~.,data = df, nvmax = 15, method = "backward")
summary(lm_bkw)
summary(lm_bkw)$adjr2
which.max(summary(lm_bkw)$adjr2)
coef(lm_bkw,8)


```

4.  Shrinkage methods - Ridge Regression and the lasso

Usually run both and select the on with better results.

Regularize coefficients shrinks towards zero - Ridge Regression: Shrink
the coefficients of variable towards zero by adding shrinkage penalty by
Tuning parameter ( select a good lambda is critical ) Not scaled for the
predictors. They should be standardized before running The model is less
flexible as the lambda increases.

-   Lasso Regression: Using this technique, with a lambda accurate, some
    coefficients can become 0 and will reduce the variables used for the
    model. ( more interpretable than ridge, less n of variables )

```{r Ridge_Lasso}
install.packages("glmnet")
library("glmnet")

x<- model.matrix(price~., data = df)[,-1]
y<- df$price
grid <- 10^seq(10,-2, length= 100)

# Ridge

lm_ridge<- glmnet(x,y,alpha = 0, lambda = grid)
summary(lm_ridge)

cv_fit<- cv.glmnet(x,y,alpha=0,lambda = grid)
plot(cv_fit)

opt_lambda<- cv_fit$lambda.min

tss <- sum((y-mean(y))^2) 

y_a <- predict(lm_ridge,s= opt_lambda, newx = x)

res <- sum((y_a-y)^2)

raq <- 1 - res/tss


# Lasso

lm_lasso <- glmnet(x,y, alpha = 1, lambda = grid)


```

## Module 8 Data preparation

```{r Import_dataset}

df<-read.csv("/home/quim/PycharmProjects/Machine learning/Complete ML in R/2. Classification/House-Price.csv", header = TRUE)

str(df)


```

1.  The data and the dictionary

Collect the data in tabular format with colnames using \_ instead of "
", with simple recognizable names.

Get only one datasaet with columns for predictors and rows or samples.
It should be linked to a data dictionary. \
- Definition o all the variables \
- Identifier ( colname) \
- Explanation o the categories of categorical variables.

```{r EDD}

# Extended data dictionary

summary(df)
boxplot(df$n_hot_rooms)

pairs(~df$Sold+df$rainfall) # Outliers

barplot(table(df$airport)) # Missing values

barplot(table(df$bus_ter)) # only 1 category its's useless, 


```

```{r Outlier_treatment}
# Capping and Flooring techniques
uv <- 3*quantile(df$n_hot_rooms, 0.99)
df$n_hot_rooms[df$n_hot_rooms>uv]<- uv
summary(df$n_hot_rooms)

lv<- 0.3*quantile(df$rainfall, 0.01)
df$rainfall[df$rainfall<lv]<- lv
summary(df$rainfall)

```

```{r Missing_value_imputation}
# Replae with mean
mean(df$n_hos_beds,na.rm =TRUE)
which(is.na(df$n_hos_beds))

df$n_hos_beds[is.na(df$n_hos_beds)]<-mean(df$n_hos_beds,na.rm =TRUE)
summary(df$n_hos_beds)

```

```{r Variable_transformation}

df$avg_dist <- (df$dist1+df$dist2+df$dist3+df$dist4)/4

df2<-df[,-6:-9]
df<- df2

# Remove uninformative variable
df<-df[,-13]
colnames(df)

```

```{r Dummie_variable_creation}
install.packages("dummies")
library("dummies")

df<- dummy.data.frame(df) # create a variable for eery category on all categorical variables
# delete usless variables
df<-df[,c(-8, -14)]

```

## Module 9: three models of classification.

1.  Classification Models

1.Logistic Regression

2.Linear discriminant Analysis

3.K nearest neighbor

Prediction Question - Will the house be sol within three months of
getting listed Inferential Question - How accurately can we estimate the
effect of each of the predictor variables on the response variable

2.Why can't we use Linear Regression

Linear regression can't be used for more than two categories

## Module 10 Logistic Regression

1.  Sigmoid Function (0-1 range) Results interpretation is different
    than on linear. Low changes due to outliers.

Maximum Likelihood method - Linear regression - Ordinary least squares -
Logistic Regression - Maximum Likelihood method

```{r Training_simple_logistic_model}

glm.fit = glm(Sold~price, data = df, family = binomial)
summary(glm.fit)



```

Results: - B =0 no relationship P-value: - Ho = No relation between X
and Y - Ha = Relationship between X and Y

2.  Logistic with multiple predictors

-   Use maximum likelihood to calculate Betas
-   Fix te boundary condition as per business requirements

```{r Multiple_logistic_regression}

glm.fit = glm(Sold~., data = df, family = binomial)
summary(glm.fit)




```

3.  Confusion Matrix Error type 1 \<- False Positive Error type 2 \<-
    False Negative NO YES Total Npred TN T2E N Ypred T1E TP P Total N\*
    P\*
4.  Evaluating model performance

FP rate \<- FP/N Type 1 error (1-specificity) TP rate \<- TP/P Type 2
error (power, sensitivity, recall) Pos. Pred. val \<- TP/P\* Precision
(1-false discovery proportion) Neg. Pred. val \<- TN/N\*

ROC curve Area under the curve False positive - Y True positive - X
(should be as near of 0,1 point as possible, maximum area)

```{r Predicting_probabilities_Assessing_classes_Making_confusion_matrix}

glm.probe <- predict(glm.fit, type = "response")
glm.probe[1:10]
glm.pred<- rep("NO",506)
glm.pred[glm.probe>0.5] <- "YES"
table(glm.pred, df$Sold) # confusion matrix





```

## Module 11 Discriminant lineal analysis (LDA)

Conditional probability ( lowest possible theoretical error rate)

```{r LDA}

install.packages("MASS")
library("MASS")

#Linear discriminate analysis
lda.fit <- lda(Sold~., data = df)
lda.fit

lda.pred <-predict(lda.fit, df)
lda.pred$posterior

lda.class <- lda.pred$class
table(lda.class, df$Sold)

sum(lda.pred$posterior[,1]>.8)

## Quartile discriminate analisis
qda.fit <- qda(Sold~., data = df)
qda.fit

qda.pred <-predict(qda.fit, df)
qda.pred$posterior

qda.class <- qda.pred$class
table(qda.class, df$Sold)

sum(qda.pred$posterior[,1]>.8)

```

## Module 12: K-nearest neighborhood

1.  Test-Train Split

Identify the minimum test error

-   Validation set approach Random division of data into two parts Usual
    split is 80:20 When to use - In case of large number of observations

-   Leave one out cross validation Leaving one observation every time
    from training set

-   K-Fold validation Divide the data into K set We will keep one
    testing and K-1 for training

```{r Test-train}
library(caTools)
set.seed(0)
split<- sample.split(df,SplitRatio = .8)

train_set<- subset ( df, split == TRUE)
test_set <- subset(df, split == FALSE)

train.fit <- glm(Sold~., data = df, family = binomial)
test_probe <- predict(train.fit, test_set, type = "response")

test.pred = rep("NO",120)
test.pred[test_probe>0.5] <- "YES"
table(test.pred, test_set$Sold)

```

2.  K-Nearest neighbors

distance between observations , scale matters (data should be
standardized)

```{r KNN}
install.packages("class")
library("class")

trainX <- train_set[,-16]
testX <- test_set[,-16]

trainY <- train_set$Sold
testY <- test_set$Sold

k = 5

trainX_s <- scale(trainX)
testX_s <- scale(testX)

set.seed(0)

knn.pred <- knn(trainX_s, testX_s, trainY,k = k)

table(knn.pred, testY)


```

## Model 13 Comparison of results from the 3 models

1.  understanding the results of classification models

## Module 14

85%

## Module 15 Basic decision trees

-   regression tree (continuous quantitative target variable)
-   classification tree (Discrete categorical target variables)

1.Understanding regression trees - Top-down greedy approach that is
known as recursive binary splitting - top-down because it begins at the
top of the tree and then successively splits the predictor space - Each
split is indicated via two new branches further down on the tree. - It
is greedy because at each step of the tree-building process, the best
spoiling is made at that articular step, rather than looking ahead and
picking a split that ll lead to a better tree in some future step.

STEPS: - Considers all predictors and all possible cut point values -
Calculate RSS for each possibility - Selects the one with least RSS -
Continues till stopping criteria is reached

2.  Stopping criteria for controlling tree growth

-   Minimum Observations at internal node
-   Minimum observations at leaf node
-   Maximum depth

```{r data_import}

movie <- read.csv("/home/quim/PycharmProjects/Machine learning/Complete ML in R/3. Decision Trees/Movie_regression.csv")
summary(movie)

movie$Time_taken[is.na(movie$Time_taken)]<- mean(movie$Time_taken, na.rm = TRUE)

```

```{r Splitting_data_into_Test_and_Train_set}

library(caTools)
set.seed(0)
split <- sample.split(movie, SplitRatio = 0.8)
train <- subset(movie, split == TRUE)
test <- subset(movie, split == FALSE)

```

```{r Building_regression_tree}
install.packages("rpart")
install.packages("rpart.plot")
library("rpart")
library("rpart.plot")

#Run regression tree modl on train set 
regtree <- rpart(formula = Collection~., data = train, control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 3))

#plot decision tree
rpart.plot(regtree, box.palette = "RdBu", digits = -3)

# Predict value at any point
test$pred <- predict(regtree, test, type = "vector")

MSE2 <- mean((test$pred - test$Collection)^2)

```

3.  Pruning a tree

```{r Pruning_a_tree}

fulltree <- rpart(formula = Collection~., data = train, control = rpart.control(cp = 0))
rpart.plot(fulltree, box.palette = "RdBu", digits = -3)
printcp(fulltree)
plotcp(regtree)

mincp <- regtree$cptable[which.min(regtree$cptable[,"xerror"]), "CP"]

pruned.tree <- prune(regtree, cp = mincp)
rpart.plot(pruned.tree,box.palette = "RdBu", digits = -3)

test$fulltree <- predict(fulltree, test, type = "vector")
MSE2 <- mean((test$fulltree - test$Collection)^2)

test$pruned <- predict(pruned.tree, test, type = "vector")
MSE2pruned <- mean((test$pruned - test$Collection)^2)


#accuracy_postprun <- mean(test$pred == test$left)
#data.frame(base_accuracy, accuracy_preprun, accuracy_postprun)

```

## Module 16 Simple classification trees

-   Regression tree
-   Classification tree

Regression (resp. variable became the prediction for that class)
Classification( We use the mode (most freq cat) of that region to
predict the outcome)

Methods: (recursive binary splitting) In regression RSS is used to
decide the split

In classification: \
- Classification error rate NÂº errors/total N \
- Gini index (more sensitive) \
- Cross entropy (more sensitive)

```{r data_classification}
df <- read.csv("/home/quim/PycharmProjects/Machine learning/Complete ML in R/3. Decision Trees/Movie_classification.csv")
```

```{r building_classification_trees }
View(df)
summary(df)

# Imputation
df$Time_taken[is.na(df$Time_taken)] <- mean(df$Time_taken, na.rm = TRUE)

#Test-Trai sets
library(caTools)
set.seed(0)
split <- sample.split(df, SplitRatio = 0.8)
trainc <- subset(df, split == TRUE)
testc <- subset(df, split == FALSE)

#Classification tree
classtree <- rpart(formula = Start_Tech_Oscar~., data = trainc, method = "class", control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 3))


# plot decision tree
rpart.plot(classtree, box.palette = "RdBu", digits = -3)

#predict value at any point
 testc$pred <- predict(classtree, testc, type = "class")

table(testc$Start_Tech_Oscar, testc$pred)

```

Advantages and disadvantages of decision trees

Advantages:

-   Easy to explain

<!-- -->

-   More closely mirror human decision making other regression and
    classification approaches

-   Trees can easily handle qualitative predictors without the need to
    create dummy variables

Disadvantages:

-   Trees generally do not have the same level of predictive accuracy as
    same of the the region and classification approaches.

## Module 17 Ensambling techniques

### Bagging

Concept: - If N observations have variance sigma sq (s\^2), then
variance of mean these observations is (s\^2)/N

Bootstrapping

1.  While bagging pruning is not done , full length trees are grown

2.Individual trees have high variance and low bias, average reduces the
variance

3.  In regression, we take the average of predicted values

4.In classification, we take majority vote (i.e. most predicted class
will be taken as the final prediction

```{r Bagging}
install.packages("randomForest")
library("randomForest")
set.seed(0)
bagging <- randomForest(Collection~., data= train, mtry= 17)
test$bagging <- predict(bagging, test)
MSE2bagging <- mean((test$bagging - test$Collection)^2)
bagging <- randomForest(Collection~., data= train, mtry= 17, importance = TRUE)

```

### Random forest

Bagging create correlated trees

Concept: We use subset of predictor variables so that we get different
spits in each model.

Thumb Rule for value of M:

1.  For regression (P/3)
2.  For classification (sqrt(P))
3.  Don't forget to use your business knowledge if the variables are
    highly correlated try a smaller value of M

```{r Random_Forest}

install.packages("randomForest")
library("randomForest")

randomfor <- randomForest(Collection~., data = train, ntree = 500)
test$random <- predict(randomfor, test)
MSE2random <- mean((test$random - test$Collection)^2)


```

### Boosting techniques

Process of urninga weak learner into a strong learner:

1.  Gradient boost

    1.  Calculate residuals

    2.  Tree after adjusting for residuals

    3.  Final tree after adjusting residuals multiple times

2.  Ada Boost

    1.  Assign more weightage to miss-classified observations

    2.  Retrain the tree after accounting for weightages

    3.  Final tree after accounting for weightages N-1 Times

3.  XG Boost

Similar to Gradient boost

XG-boost used more regularized model formalization to control
over-fitting, which gives it better performance.

Regularization - The cost function we are trying to optimize ( MSE in
regression... ) also contains a penalty term for number of variables. In
a way, we want to minimize the number of variables in final model along
with the MSE or accuracy. This helps avoiding overfitting.

XG-boost contains regularization terms in the cost function.

## Module 18 Concept

### Maximum margin classification (Separable data)

Maximal margin classifier:

1.  Calculate the perpendicular distance of observations from hyperplane
2.  Minimum value of distance is called margin
3.  Choose the hyperplane with maximum value of margin

Support vectors:

1.  The observations which fall on margin are known as Support Vectors
2.  These classifiers depend on support vectors only
3.  That is why this technique is different from conventional ML
    techniques

Limitations of MMC:

1.  MMC can't be used if the two classes are not separable by a
    hyperplane
2.  MMC is very sensitive to support vectors, an additional observation
    can lead to a dramatic shift in the maximal margin hyperplane

### Support vector classification (Non-separable data)

Support vector classifier:

-   What:

    -   Support vector classifier is a soft margin classifier

    -   We will allow some observations to be incorrectly classify or to
        be on the wrong side of the margin

-   How:

    -   We can create a miss-classification budget (B)

    -   We limit sum of distances of the points on the wrong side of the
        margin (x1+ x2+ x3 +x4) \<B

    -   We try to maximize margin while trying to stay within budget.

    -   Usually in our software packages we use C (Cost - multiplier of
        the error term ) which is inversely related to B

-   Impact of C:

    -   When C is small, margins will be wide and there will be many
        support vectors and many miss-classified observations

    -   When C is large, margins will be narrow and there will be narrow
        and there will be fewer support vectors and fewer
        miss-classified values

    -   However, low cost value prevents overfitting and may give better
        test set performance

    -   We try to find optimal value of C at which we get vest test
        performance.

-   Limitations of SVC:

    -   Support vector classifier is a linear classifier, it cannot
        classify non linear separable data

### Support vector machines (Non linear class boundaries)

Kernel based SVM

-   What:

    -   Support vector machine (SVM) s an extension of the support
        vector classifier which uses Kernels to create non linear
        boundaries

    -   Kernels - Some functional relationship between two observations.

        Some popular Kernels are:

        -   Linear

            Linear kernel takes inner product of two observations ( it's
            effectively a support vector classifier)

        -   Polynomial

            Polynomial Kernel uses power function to create non linear
            boundaries

        -   Radial

            Radial Kernel uses radial function to create radial
            boundaries

            Gamma defines how much influence a single training example
            has. The larger gamma is, the closer other examples must be
            to be affected.
